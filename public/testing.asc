Chapter 2.  Forces

In the final example of Chapter 1, we saw how we could calculate a dynamic acceleration based on a vector pointing from a circle on the screen to the mouse location.   The resulting motion resembled a magnetic attraction between circle and mouse, as if some _force_ were pulling the circle in towards the mouse.  In this chapter we will formalize our understanding of the concept of a *_force_* and its relationship to *_acceleration_*.    Our goal, by the end of this chapter, is to understand how to make multiple objects move around the screen and respond to a variety of environmental forces.

We could use the above methodology to create a random walker that tends to move to the right.  Here is an example of a Walker with the following probabilities:

[classname="packed"]
- _chance of moving up: 	20%_
- _chance of moving down: 	20%_
- _chance of moving left: 	20%_
- _chance of moving right: 	40%_
